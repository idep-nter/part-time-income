I was wondering what program I could really use in everyday life and here it is - monthly net wage for part-timers.
A user is asked to enter neccesary data such as if he's a student, what type of a contract he has, his hour wage etc.
It only works for CZ since I have no idea how it works anywhere else.

*it might not be 100 % accurate!
