I was wondering what program I could really use in everyday life and here it is - monthly net wage for part-timers.
User is asked to enter neccesary data such as if he's student, what type of contract he has, hour wage etc.
It only works for CZ since I don't have idea how it works anywhere else.

*it might be not 100 % accurate!
